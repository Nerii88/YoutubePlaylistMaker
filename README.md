# YoutubePlaylistMaker
Make youtube playlists easily all on a dynamically loading page!
Project made in Visual Studio 2013.
For now only the front end functionality is there.
The "Fill Playlist" button on top of the page is only there to fill up the playlist with pre determined videos quickly. Will be removed later.
