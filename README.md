# YoutubePlaylistMaker
Make youtube playlists easily all on a dynamically loading page!
Project made in Visual Studio 2013.
For now only the front end functionality is there (can't log in, can't save playlists).

Disclaimer: The "Fill Playlist" button on top of the page is only there to fill up the playlist with pre determined videos quickly. Will be removed later.
