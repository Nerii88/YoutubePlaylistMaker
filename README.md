# YoutubePlaylistMaker
Make youtube playlists easily all on a dynamically loading page!
Project made in Visual Studio 2013.
Database is not added yet (can't save or update playlists that will be there next time you run the site, log in with whatever name/password(6chars+) to see prebuilt playlists).
